There are several interesting interactions and rules in this game that the fish should avoid moving above the water and touching the fishing rod, and try to eat as many shells as possible.  Everything is very similar to the real condition of the ocean. In general, this is an amazing process of making this project, that since I fail to think everything at the beginning, almost all the great things I have now is made up of lots of times of trying and adjusting. Every time you see the project becomes better, you can feel a sense of achievement in your mind, which is really good.</p>
